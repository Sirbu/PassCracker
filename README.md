# Python-scripts
Some scripts I began to write while I was reading "Violent Python".

# Things to do :
cuckoo :
-> Adapt the algorithm designated by the id in the password file
-> Multi-threading for performance
-> Display the percentage of progression (not a huge priority but could be nice)

banner :
-> Fix this shit !
-> Make it more like a simple scanner...
